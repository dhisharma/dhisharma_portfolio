                  Hi, I am here to help your next project!
                </h2>

                    I currently am working as a Web Developer at Accenture,
                    which is where my passion for development and design
                    converge. I am also working on a few side projects. Since
                    beginning of my journey as a Web Developer nearly 8 years
                    ago, I've done remote work for agencies, consulted for
                    startups, and collaborated with talented people to create
                    digital products for both business and consumer use. I'm
                    quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually
                    working on improving my chops one design problem at a time.
